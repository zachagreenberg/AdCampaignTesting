# AdCampaignTesting

by Zachary Greenberg  

# Overview
The two worlds of Marketing and Sales go hand in hand. Often with great marketing, comes great sales. It can be a symbiotic relationship. A way to test your marketing strategy is to over different versions of your marketing ads and pin them against eachother. This will allow to you understand not only which marketing campaign achieved more, but it will allow you to understand what about the marketing campaign was superior to the other. From synthetically generated data, I have set out to test two groups of virtual marketing campaigns right around the holiday season.   

# Business Problem
Ads are crucial to letting people know about products or great sales that are already available or to be released in the weeks coming. If we can compare the amount of clicks and the revenue on different ads for the same product, we can be in the know and discover more effective advertising strategies.   

# Data
My data for this mini-project has been synthetically generated utilizing the Python library [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/). The following categories were created:  
-campaign_start: the beginning date of the campaign    
-campaign_end: the end date of the campaign    
-ad_version: the version of the ad being presented    
-age: the age of the person recieving the ad  
-sex: the sex of the person recieving the ad  
-state: the state in which the person is from  
-clicked_on_ad: whether or not the person clicked on the ad  
-amount_spent: the amount spent at the store if the person clicked on the ad
